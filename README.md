In this building a web api that predicts the malicious and benign queries activities by applying machine learning techniques.Most of the web based applications are facing attacks like SQL injection,blind sql types of attacks.To overcome from this we are building a model that classifies these type of attacks.First thing is to gather all the mallicious queries across the internet.It would be good if the gathered information might be as long as possible and make a datasets of benign and malicious queries.Second thing is to preprocess the data and apply the machine learning models and compare the results.And lastly select that model which predicts these activities more effifiently and start applying the builded model in the real time websites
